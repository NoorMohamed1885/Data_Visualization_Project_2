    - Next steps would be adding a way to select any country with their year 
    population and have a more detailed visual of the country. For this I would need 
    a dataset with geographical coordinates.
    - For the graphs and charts I would also like to add some different colors since
    I had just went for a more default blues.
    - For the design I would would like different colors options and a better way to 
    organize how the information is being represented to the user.

    Reflection:\n
    - One of the things that had changed from the lab 4.3 to the project was
    changing the layout. Instead of having the multi selection and slider
    on the sidebar it is now on the page. 
    - Another change was the maps used. The maps are different because the type of
    data represented was for the world instead of one country.
